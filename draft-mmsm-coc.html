  <p><em>

      This is still work in progress, an adaptation of the
      Linux Australia Code of Conduct to the circumstances of
      MMSM.  It was originally designed for the conference
      linux.conf.au, so needs some changes in particular to suit
      a meetup, though the overall spirit is I think what we
      want. &mdash; LJK

  <h1>Melbourne Maths Science Meetup Code of Conduct</h1>
  
    <p>
      *This bit particularly needs reworking.*
      Linux Australia is committed to the ideals expressed in
      our <a href="http://linux.org.au/values">Values
      Statement</a> and ask all our members, speakers,
      volunteers, attendees and guests to adopt these
      principles. We are a diverse community. Sometimes this
      means we need to work harder to ensure we're creating an
      environment of trust and respect where all who come to
      participate feel comfortable and included.
    </p>
    <p>We value your participation and appreciate your help in
    realising this goal.</p>

    <h2 id="be-respectful">Be respectful</h2>
    <p>
      Respect yourself, and respect others.  Be courteous to
      those around you.  If someone indicates they don't wish to
      be photographed, respect that wish.  If someone indicates
      they would like to be left alone, let them be.  Our event
      venues and online spaces may be shared with members of the
      public; please be considerate to all patrons of these
      locations.
    </p>

    <h2 id="be-inclusive">Be inclusive</h2>
    <p>All presentation material should be suitable for people
    aged 12 and above.</p>
    <p>Any public presentation which is part of any event,
    including but not limited to keynotes, presentations,
    lightning talks, addresses, mailing list posts and forums,
    is subject to this code of conduct and thus may not
    contain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>sexual or violent imagery;</li>
      <li>exclusionary language;</li>
      <li>insults or ad-hominem attacks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the subject matter of the presentation cannot be
    presented adequately without including language that could
    be considered offensive, this should be pointed out in
    advance, at the beginning of the talk and in the
    schedule.</p>
    <p>If presenters are unsure whether their material is
    suitable, they are encouraged to show it to the conference’s
    speaker liaison or mailing list/forum moderators before
    their session.</p>
    <p>Presenters and attendees are asked to avoid language
    which is not appropriate for an all-ages audience as much as
    possible.</p>

    <h2 id="be-aware">Be aware</h2>
    <p>We ask everyone to be aware that we will not tolerate
    intimidation, harassment, or any abusive, discriminatory or
    derogatory behaviour by anyone at any event in person or
    online.</p>

    <h2 id="what-does-that-mean-for-me">What does that mean for
    me?</h2>
    <p>All participants, including event attendees and speakers
    must not engage in any intimidation, harassment, or abusive
    or discriminatory behaviour.</p>
    <p>If you experience or observe any of these behaviours we
    ask that you report them through the appropriate
    channel.</p>

    <h2 id="complaints-and-reports">Complaints and reports</h2>
    <p>Complaints and reports can be made to the organisers by
      contacting the registration desk or mailing list/forum
      moderators by contacting the relevant email addresses.
      All complaints made to event organisers will remain
      confidential and be taken seriously.  The complaint will
      be treated appropriately with discretion.  Should event
      organisers or moderators consider it appropriate, measures
      they may take include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the individuals may be told to apologise</li>
      <li>the individuals may be told to stop/modify their
      behaviour appropriately</li>
      <li>the individuals may be warned that enforcement action
      may be taken if the behaviour continues</li>
      <li>the individuals may be asked to immediately leave the
      venue and/or will be prohibited from continuing to attend
      the event</li>
      <li>the incident may be reported to the appropriate
      authorities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of behaviours that have occurred
    at past events which are not appropriate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>offensive verbal or written remarks related to gender,
      sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
      size, race or religion;</li>
      <li>sexual or violent images in public spaces (including
      presentation slides);</li>
      <li>deliberate intimidation;</li>
      <li>stalking or following;</li>
      <li>unwanted photography or recording;</li>
      <li>sustained disruption of talks or other events;</li>
      <li>intoxication at an event venue;</li>
      <li>inappropriate physical contact;</li>
      <li>unwelcome sexual attention;</li>
      <li>sexist, racist, or other exclusionary jokes;</li>
      <li>unwarranted exclusion from conference or related
      events based on age, gender, sexual orientation,
      disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
      religion;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We want everyone to have a good time at our events.</p>
